Good work!  Your program is very clean and well-organized.

Your closing braces, however, were pretty scattered.  Sometimes
they were at the same indentation level as your method, and sometimes
they were all the way at the left margin.  Your Letter1() method also
had inconsistent indentation from the rest of your letter methods.  So,
I took off one point for Consistent Style.

For future projects, you will want to start adding comments.
Everybody does comments slightly differently, but at a minimum
it would have been good to have a comment for the methods that
were letters and the methods that were shared paragraphs.
